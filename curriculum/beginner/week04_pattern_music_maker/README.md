# Week 4: Pattern Music Maker

> ðŸ“š **Reference**: This module is aligned with the [SAM LMS Scope & Sequence](../../scope-and-sequence.md)

## Overview

In Week 4, learners explore pattern recognition through music and rhythm, connecting computational thinking with South African musical traditions. Students create simple musical sequences using physical computing devices, discovering how patterns form the foundation of both music and code.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, learners will be able to:

- **Recognize and create patterns** in musical sequences
- **Use loops and repetition** in code to generate rhythmic patterns
- **Connect computational thinking** to traditional South African music
- **Program simple outputs** (buzzers/speakers) on Raspberry Pi Pico
- **Apply decomposition** to break down complex rhythms into simple patterns

## Computational Thinking Pillars

### Pattern Recognition
- Identifying repeating elements in traditional rhythms
- Recognizing similar structures in different musical pieces
- Finding patterns in drum circles and call-and-response songs

### Abstraction
- Representing complex rhythms with simple symbols
- Using musical notation as a form of abstraction
- Translating sounds into code sequences

### Algorithm Design
- Creating step-by-step instructions for musical patterns
- Sequencing notes and beats in logical order
- Using loops to repeat musical phrases

## CAPS Curriculum Connections

### Creative Arts (Foundation Phase)
- Music: Rhythm, tempo, and pattern
- Cultural songs and musical heritage
- Creative expression through sound

### Mathematics
- Patterns, functions, and algebra
- Number sequences and counting
- Time intervals and duration

### Languages
- Listening and speaking (rhythm and oral traditions)
- Following instructions
- Cultural storytelling through song

## Cultural & Contextual Notes

### South African Musical Heritage

This module honors the rich musical traditions of South Africa:

- **Gumboot Dancing**: Rhythmic patterns created by mining workers
- **Mbube/Isicathamiya**: Call-and-response harmonies (made famous by Ladysmith Black Mambazo)
- **Traditional Drums**: Djembe and talking drum patterns
- **Children's Clapping Games**: Pattern-based songs like "Diketo" and "Morabaraba"

### Ubuntu Connection

*"Ubuntu ngumuntu ngabantu"* - Music brings communities together. This module emphasizes:
- **Collective rhythm**: Working together to create harmony
- **Cultural preservation**: Honoring traditional songs and rhythms
- **Intergenerational learning**: Learning patterns from elders and community members

## Project Activities

### Main Activity: Create a Pattern Music Maker

Students will:
1. Learn about traditional South African rhythms
2. Decompose a rhythm into simple pattern elements
3. Write code to play repeating patterns using a buzzer
4. Experiment with different tempos and sequences
5. Combine patterns to create original compositions

### Extension Activities
- Create a "talking drum" simulator with different tones
- Program call-and-response patterns
- Design a rhythm game that teaches traditional patterns

## Portfolio Artifacts

Students should collect:
- [ ] Photos/videos of their pattern music maker in action
- [ ] Written or drawn representation of their rhythm patterns
- [ ] Code printouts with annotations
- [ ] Reflection on connections between music and computational thinking
- [ ] Recording of traditional rhythm they researched

## Resources Needed

### Hardware
- Raspberry Pi Pico (or compatible microcontroller)
- Passive buzzer or small speaker
- Connecting wires
- Breadboard
- Optional: Push buttons for interactive control

### Software
- Thonny IDE with MicroPython
- Code examples (see `/code` folder)

### Cultural Resources
- Recordings of traditional South African music
- Information about local musical traditions
- Community members who can share musical heritage

## Differentiation Support

### For Emerging Learners
- Start with very simple 2-3 beat patterns
- Use visual representations (drawings) before code
- Focus on one instrument/sound at a time
- Provide pre-written code templates to modify

### For Advancing Learners
- Create complex multi-layered rhythms
- Incorporate user input (buttons) for interactive music
- Research and program authentic traditional patterns
- Combine multiple buzzers for harmony

### Multilingual Support
- Teach musical terms in isiZulu, isiXhosa, Sepedi, etc.
- Use call-and-response songs in home languages
- Connect rhythm patterns to language syllables

## Assessment Opportunities

- **Formative**: Observe pattern recognition during musical activities
- **Performance**: Successful creation of repeating pattern in code
- **Reflection**: Student explanations of pattern-music connections
- **Cultural Knowledge**: Identification of traditional rhythm patterns

## Week 4 Connection to Programme Goals

This week builds on:
- **Week 1-3**: Basic programming, sequencing, and pattern recognition

This week prepares for:
- **Week 5-7**: More complex pattern applications and creative projects
- **Week 8**: Showcase of integrated learning
