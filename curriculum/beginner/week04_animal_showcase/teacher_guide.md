# Week 04 Teacher Guide — Animal Showcase & Debugging

## Overview
- **CT Pillars:** Decomposition, algorithm design
- **CAPS Links:** Mathematics (sequencing), Life Skills (working with others), Languages (oral presentation)
- **Duration:** 2 × 35-minute sessions
- **Summary:** Learners refine their animal movement projects, practise debugging, and host a mini showcase with peer feedback.

## Learning Objectives
1. Break the animal movement performance into a sequence of clear steps.
2. Identify and fix simple issues (inputs not triggering, timing off) using a debugging checklist.
3. Present the animal story with accurate vocabulary and sensor usage.
4. Offer constructive feedback referencing CT language.

## Materials
- Circuit Playground Express devices with Week 03 code
- Debugging checklist cards
- Showcase signage and peer feedback sheets
- Timer or chime for rotation

## Session Flow
### Session 1: Debug & Polish
1. **Warm-up (5 min):** “Robot says” sequencing game.
2. **Debug Demo (7 min):** Teacher introduces bug (wrong touch pad). Class suggests fixes.
3. **Team Work Time (18 min):** Groups rehearse; use checklist: Input? Output? Timing? Narration?
4. **Share (5 min):** Each group states one bug they fixed and how.

### Session 2: Showcase
1. **Setup (5 min):** Arrange stations; assign peer reviewer roles.
2. **Showcase Rotations (20 min):** Groups perform while others complete feedback slips.
3. **Reflection (8 min):** Discuss what made an effective algorithm (clear steps, predictable outputs).
4. **Celebrate (2 min):** Ubuntu clap for all teams.

## Differentiation
- Provide “If ___ then ___” sentence frames.
- Allow shy learners to record narration ahead of time.
- Challenge advanced learners to chain two sensor inputs for combined behaviours.

## Troubleshooting
- Keep spare USB cable ready.
- If timing drifts, insert short `time.sleep` adjustments.

## Assessment
- Use rubric snippet focusing on algorithm clarity and debugging reflection.
- Collect peer feedback slips for evidence of CT vocabulary.
