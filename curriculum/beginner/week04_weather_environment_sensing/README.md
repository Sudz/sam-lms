# Week 4: Weather Environment Sensing

> **Programme Alignment:** This week's content is drawn from the official [SAM LMS Scope & Sequence](../../scope-and-sequence.md)

## Project Summary

In Week 4, learners explore environmental sensing through weather data collection and monitoring. Students use sensors to measure temperature, humidity, and other environmental conditions, connecting computational thinking to real-world climate awareness and Ubuntu principles of caring for our shared environment.

## Learning Objectives

### Computational Thinking
- **Pattern Recognition:** Identify weather patterns and trends in collected data
- **Data Collection:** Gather and organize environmental sensor readings
- **Abstraction:** Represent weather conditions through visual indicators and alerts
- **Sequencing:** Create logical steps for sensor monitoring and response

### Technical Skills
- Reading sensor data using Raspberry Pi Pico
- Processing environmental measurements
- Creating visual feedback with LEDs
- Basic data logging and pattern observation

## CAPS Curriculum Connections

### Natural Sciences and Technology (Foundation Phase)
- Understanding weather and seasons
- Observing and describing environmental changes
- Using tools to measure and collect data
- Making predictions based on observations

### Mathematics
- Measuring and comparing quantities
- Reading and interpreting simple data
- Understanding concepts of more/less, hot/cold

### Life Skills
- Environmental awareness and care
- Community responsibility for shared spaces
- Understanding how weather affects daily life

## Cultural Connections

### Ubuntu Values
- **Community Care:** Monitoring our shared environment
- **Interconnectedness:** Understanding how weather affects everyone
- **Responsibility:** Taking care of our natural surroundings

### Indigenous Knowledge
- Traditional weather prediction methods
- Seasonal awareness in South African communities
- Connection between weather and agricultural practices
- Respect for natural cycles and environmental balance

## Portfolio Artifacts

Students will create:
1. Weather monitoring station with LED indicators
2. Data collection log showing environmental readings
3. Pattern identification drawings or charts
4. Reflection on environmental stewardship and Ubuntu

## Resources Needed

### Hardware
- Raspberry Pi Pico
- Temperature/humidity sensor (DHT11 or DHT22)
- LEDs for status indicators
- Breadboard and jumper wires
- USB cable for power and programming

### Digital Resources
- Sample sensor code (see `code/` folder)
- Weather tracking templates (see `assets/` folder)
- Connection diagrams

## Implementation Guide

### Session Structure (2-3 lessons)
1. **Introduction:** Discuss weather, seasons, and how we measure them
2. **Exploration:** Build sensor circuit and collect data
3. **Pattern Discovery:** Analyze collected readings
4. **Creative Response:** Design visual feedback system
5. **Reflection:** Connect to environmental care and Ubuntu

### Differentiation Strategies

**For emerging learners:**
- Focus on simple hot/cold, wet/dry observations
- Use visual color-coding for different readings
- Provide pre-made circuit diagrams

**For advancing learners:**
- Track data over multiple days
- Create graphs or charts
- Design alert systems for extreme conditions
- Explore multiple sensor types

## Assessment

### Formative
- Observation during sensor setup and data collection
- Discussion of weather patterns and Ubuntu connections
- Participation in collaborative monitoring

### Summative
- Functioning weather monitoring station
- Completed data collection log
- Explanation of patterns observed
- Reflection on environmental responsibility

## Extension Activities

- Compare weather data with traditional prediction methods
- Interview elders about traditional weather knowledge
- Design weather alerts for school community
- Create multilingual weather reports
- Connect with other schools to compare regional data

## Teacher Resources

For detailed implementation guidance, see:
- `teacher-guide.md` (in this folder)
- `student-worksheet.md` (in this folder)
- Sample code in `code/weather_sensor.py`
- Visual assets in `assets/` folder
