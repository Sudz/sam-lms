# Week 7: Digital Ubuntu Journey

> ðŸ“š **Reference**: This module is aligned with the [SAM LMS Scope & Sequence](../../scope-and-sequence.md)

## Overview

In Week 7, learners embark on a creative culminating project that integrates all concepts learned in previous weeks. Students design and build a "Digital Ubuntu Journey" - an interactive physical computing project that tells a story, demonstrates Ubuntu values, and showcases their computational thinking skills. This project emphasizes creativity, cultural expression, and the meaningful application of technology to strengthen community bonds.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, learners will be able to:

- **Integrate multiple concepts** from previous weeks (sensors, outputs, patterns, interaction)
- **Design and build** a complete physical computing project from concept to implementation
- **Tell a story** using technology that reflects Ubuntu values and South African culture
- **Apply the full design process**: ideate, plan, build, test, iterate, present
- **Collaborate effectively** with peers to create meaningful projects
- **Present and explain** their work to others, demonstrating computational thinking
- **Reflect on learning** and articulate connections between technology and community

## Computational Thinking Pillars

### Integration of All Pillars

This week brings together everything learned:

- **Decomposition**: Breaking the project into manageable parts (story, inputs, outputs, code)
- **Pattern Recognition**: Using patterns learned in previous weeks (loops, sequences, rhythms)
- **Abstraction**: Representing complex Ubuntu concepts through simple interactive elements
- **Algorithm Design**: Creating step-by-step project plans and code logic
- **Data Collection**: Optionally incorporating sensor readings from Week 5
- **Conditional Logic**: Using if/then statements from Week 6 for interactivity
- **Debugging**: Testing and refining projects to work correctly

## CAPS Curriculum Connections

### Integrated Across Subjects

Week 7 naturally integrates learning across the curriculum:

**Languages**: Storytelling, oral presentation, written reflection, multilingual content  
**Life Skills**: Creative thinking, problem-solving, Ubuntu values, cultural identity  
**Creative Arts**: Design, aesthetics, performance, cultural expression  
**Technology**: Design process, systems thinking, structures, processing  
**Mathematics**: Logic, patterns, sequencing, measurement (if using sensors)  
**Social Sciences**: Community, heritage, South African culture, Ubuntu philosophy

## Cultural & Contextual Notes

### Ubuntu as the Central Theme

**"Ubuntu ngumuntu ngabantu" - I am because we are**

This project centers on Ubuntu philosophy, the foundation of South African cultural identity:

- **Interconnectedness**: We are all connected - humans, technology, nature, community
- **Compassion**: Technology should serve with kindness and empathy
- **Dignity**: Every person and story deserves respect and honor
- **Community**: We are stronger together; technology connects us
- **Humanity**: At the core of all technology should be human values

### South African Cultural Storytelling

Traditional storytelling methods inform digital projects:

- **Oral Tradition**: Stories passed down through generations
- **Call and Response**: Community participation in storytelling
- **Symbolic Representation**: Animals, nature, ancestors carry meaning
- **Moral Lessons**: Stories teach Ubuntu values and life wisdom
- **Community Gathering**: Storytelling brings people together
- **Multi-sensory**: Music, rhythm, movement, visual art combined

### Digital Storytelling in African Context

Modern technology continues ancient traditions:

- Preserving indigenous languages and cultural knowledge
- Sharing stories across distances (connecting rural and urban families)
- Documenting oral histories for future generations
- Creating accessible content for diverse audiences
- Empowering youth to express cultural identity
- Building digital archives of African heritage

## Project Activities

### Main Activity: Create Your Digital Ubuntu Journey

Students design and build an interactive project that tells a personal or community story reflecting Ubuntu values.

#### Project Framework:

**1. Story Ideation (Day 1)**
- Choose a story theme: personal journey, family history, community hero, cultural tradition, Ubuntu value
- Sketch the story arc: beginning, middle, end
- Identify Ubuntu values to highlight
- Plan interactive elements

**2. Technical Planning (Day 1-2)**
- Select inputs: buttons, sensors (temperature, light, motion)
- Select outputs: LEDs, buzzer, display
- Design interaction flow diagram
- Write pseudocode for main logic

**3. Building & Coding (Day 2-3)**
- Assemble hardware components
- Write code step-by-step (test as you go!)
- Integrate inputs and outputs
- Debug and refine

**4. Testing & Iteration (Day 3-4)**
- Test all features thoroughly
- Ask peers to try the project
- Gather feedback and improve
- Add polish (visual design, clear instructions)

**5. Presentation & Reflection (Day 4-5)**
- Prepare to present: explain story, demonstrate project, share learning
- Present to class/community
- Reflect on the journey
- Celebrate achievements!

#### Example Project Ideas:

- **"My Family's Journey"**: Interactive timeline with LEDs showing important moments, buttons to hear stories
- **"Gogo's Wisdom"**: Press buttons to hear traditional sayings, LEDs show understanding levels
- **"Community Garden Story"**: Sensors track "plant growth" (light/temperature), LEDs show seasons
- **"Ubuntu Heroes"**: Interactive game honoring local community helpers (like Week 6 but personalized)
- **"Cultural Music Box"**: Buttons play traditional rhythms (Week 4), LEDs dance with music
- **"Seasonal Traditions"**: Environmental sensors trigger stories about cultural celebrations (Week 5)
- **"Language Learning Journey"**: Interactive multilingual storytelling with visual/audio feedback

### Extension Activities

- Create a project video explaining the story and technology
- Write reflective essays connecting project to Ubuntu philosophy
- Design project packaging/display for community exhibition
- Develop user manuals in multiple languages
- Create collaborative class project combining individual stories
