# Week 7: Ubuntu Community

> **Programme Alignment:** This week's content is drawn from the official [SAM LMS Scope & Sequence](../../scope-and-sequence.md)

## Project Summary

In Week 7, learners celebrate and apply Ubuntu principles through a culminating community project. Students integrate all computational thinking skills learned in previous weeks to create solutions that benefit their school community. This week emphasizes collaboration, cultural values, and using technology to strengthen community bonds.

- **Data Representation:** Present community information effectively

### Technical Skills
- Integrating multiple sensors and outputs
- Creating user-friendly interfaces
- Testing and debugging complex systems
- Documenting projects clearly
- Presenting technical work to non-technical audiences

## CAPS Curriculum Connections

## Cultural Connections

### Ubuntu Values (Core Focus)
- **"I am because we are"** - The foundation of all projects
- **Community First:** Technology serves people and strengthens bonds
- **Shared Responsibility:** We care for our community together
- **Collective Wisdom:** Everyone's ideas make solutions better
- **Mutual Support:** Helping others helps everyone

### Indigenous Knowledge
- Traditional community problem-solving methods
- Collective decision-making processes
- Intergenerational knowledge sharing
- Community ceremonies and gatherings
- Cultural practices that strengthen bonds

## Portfolio Artifacts

Students will create:
1. Community needs assessment documentation
2. Project proposal with Ubuntu connections
3. Working prototype or demonstration
4. Multilingual user guide or instructions
5. Presentation showcasing community impact
6. Reflection on Ubuntu principles in practice

## Resources Needed

### Hardware

- Multiple sensors (students choose based on project)
- LEDs, buttons, displays
- Breadboard and jumper wires
- Optional: additional materials for physical construction

### Digital Resources
- Project planning templates (see `assets/` folder)
- Community needs assessment guides
- Sample code modules (see `code/` folder)
- Presentation templates

### Community Resources
- Input from teachers, staff, and learners
- Feedback from community members
- Cultural advisors or elders (if appropriate)

## Sample Ubuntu Community Projects

### 1. Ubuntu Greeting Station
- Multilingual welcome system for school entrance
- Sensors detect visitors and display greetings in multiple languages
- Celebrates linguistic diversity and hospitality

### 2. Community Helper Alert System
- Students can signal when they need help
- Creates culture of mutual support
- Integrates physical buttons with visual/audio feedback

### 3. Environmental Stewardship Monitor
- Track water, energy, or waste in communal areas
- Encourages collective responsibility for resources
- Displays data to motivate community action

### 4. Ubuntu Story Sharing Station
- Digital storytelling platform for sharing community wisdom
- Records and displays stories from learners, teachers, elders
- Preserves and celebrates cultural heritage

### 5. Accessibility Helper
- Tools to make school more accessible for all
- Examples: visual cues for hearing impaired, audio cues for visually impaired
- Embodies Ubuntu principle of caring for everyone

## Implementation Guide

### Week Structure (4-5 lessons)

**Lesson 1: Community Needs Discovery**
- Discuss Ubuntu and community challenges
- Observe and interview community members
- Identify problems technology could help solve
- Form project teams

**Lesson 2: Project Planning**
- Choose project focus
- Plan using computational thinking
- Design solution with Ubuntu principles
- Create project timeline

**Lesson 3-4: Building and Testing**
- Construct prototype
- Test with community feedback
- Iterate and improve
- Debug and refine

**Lesson 5: Presentation and Celebration**
- Present projects to school community
- Demonstrate Ubuntu connections
- Celebrate collective achievement
- Reflect on learning journey

### Differentiation Strategies

**For emerging learners:**
- Provide structured project templates
- Offer pre-selected project options
- Assign specific roles in group work
- Use visual planning tools
- Focus on one sensor/output combination

**For advancing learners:**
- Design original projects from scratch
- Integrate multiple sensors and outputs
- Create comprehensive documentation
- Lead team coordination
- Present to wider community audiences

## Assessment

### Formative

- Technical documentation
- Group collaboration and individual contributions
- Personal reflection on Ubuntu values

## Extension Activities

**Community Integration:**
- Install projects in actual school spaces
- Create maintenance and user guides
- Train others to use/maintain projects
- Present at school assembly or parent evening
- Share projects with other schools

**Documentation and Sharing:**
- Create video demonstrations
- Write project blog posts or articles

## Ubuntu Principles in Action

### Throughout This Week, Emphasize:

**Collective Problem-Solving:**
"We solve problems together. Everyone's voice matters."

**Shared Benefit:**
"Our technology helps everyone. When we lift others, we lift ourselves."

**Mutual Responsibility:**
"We care for our community. Our projects show we care."

**Cultural Pride:**
"We honor our heritage. Our Ubuntu values make our community strong."

**Continuous Learning:**
"We learn from everyone - peers, teachers, elders, and our community."
