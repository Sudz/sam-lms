Adaptation Guide for Teachers:

1. Hardware Integration:
   - Add sensor reading code (temperature, distance, motion, etc.)
   - Add output code (LEDs, displays, speakers, etc.)
   - Connect physical buttons or switches

2. Project Customization:
   - Modify greetings for your school's languages
   - Add specific community needs from your context
   - Include local cultural elements

3. Assessment Opportunities:
   - Team collaboration and roles
   - Problem-solving process
   - Ubuntu values demonstration
   - Technical implementation
   - Community benefit and feedback

4. Extension Ideas:
   - Connect to actual school systems
   - Create permanent installations
   - Design user training materials
   - Present at school assemblies
   - Share with other schools

Remember: The best Ubuntu projects come from listening to your
community and working together to create real solutions!
