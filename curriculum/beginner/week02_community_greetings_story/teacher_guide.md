# Week 02 Teacher Guide — Community Greeting Stories

## Overview
- **CT Pillars:** Decomposition, abstraction
- **CAPS Links:** Languages (storytelling, listening), Life Skills (social development), Creative Arts (dramatic play)
- **Duration:** 2 × 35-minute sessions
- **Summary:** Learners script and perform greeting exchanges that combine spoken language with light responses, breaking stories into steps and abstracting key ideas.

## Learning Objectives
1. Decompose a short greeting story into beginning, middle, and end actions.
2. Use multicultural greetings with matching light cues to represent characters or moods.
3. Abstract key details from a peer’s story and retell it using their own words.
4. Collaborate to present a respectful community welcome scene.

## Materials
- Story planning mats (3-panel comic strips)
- Circuit Playground Express devices with Week 01 code
- Costume props (scarves, hats) or paper puppets
- Audio recorder (tablet/phone) for performances
- Optional unplugged cards (character, setting, greeting)

## Session Flow
### Session 1: Plan the Story
1. **Hook (5 min):** Play audio of a busy taxi rank greeting scene. Discuss who is speaking and why.
2. **Review Inputs/Outputs (5 min):** Ask learners to recall which button lights matched which greeting.
3. **Mini-Lesson (10 min):** Model decomposing a story into 3 steps on chart paper.
4. **Team Planning (12 min):** Groups of 3 complete planning mat (character, greeting, light response). Teacher circulates prompting abstraction (“Which details matter most?”).
5. **Exit Ticket (3 min):** Learners whisper the first step of their story to teacher.

### Session 2: Rehearse & Perform
1. **Warm-up (5 min):** Quick call-and-response greetings.
2. **Rehearsal (10 min):** Groups practise pressing buttons at correct cue.
3. **Performance (15 min):** Present stories. Capture audio/video for portfolios.
4. **Feedback (5 min):** Use two-stars-and-a-wish sticky notes focused on CT language (“Great decomposition when…”, “Try abstracting…”).

## Differentiation
- Provide picture-supported sentence starters.
- Allow learners to draw light patterns if devices are limited.
- Encourage bilingual pairs to introduce additional greetings.

## Troubleshooting
- If groups forget steps, point to planning mat.
- For simultaneous button presses, assign “Tech Captain” role.

## Assessment
- Checklist: story has 3 steps, correct greeting/button pairing, partner retell accuracy.
- Collect audio recordings for formative language assessment.
