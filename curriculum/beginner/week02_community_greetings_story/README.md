# Week 2: Community Greeting Stories

> **Reference:** [SAM LMS Scope & Sequence](../../scope-and-sequence.md)

## Project Overview

Building on Week 1's greeting explorations, learners now craft complete narratives around greetings and social interactions. This week emphasizes storytelling—a core element of South African oral traditions—while introducing decomposition and abstraction as tools for breaking down complex stories into manageable, codable parts.

## Learning Objectives

### Computational Thinking Pillars
- **Decomposition**: Breaking stories into scenes, dialogue, and actions
- **Abstraction**: Identifying essential story elements and key moments

### CAPS Curriculum Links
- **Languages**: Narrative storytelling, dialogue writing, multilingual expression
- **Creative Arts**: Storyboarding, dramatic expression, visual storytelling

## Cultural Connection

This project deepens Ubuntu principles through storytelling:
- Creating multilingual dialogue scripts featuring greetings and social exchanges
- Exploring Ubuntu values: "I am because we are" through community-centered narratives
- Honoring South African oral storytelling traditions through digital expression
- Integrating home languages and cultural storytelling patterns

## Key Activities

1. **Story Decomposition**: Breaking a greeting scenario into beginning, middle, and end
2. **Dialogue Script Writing**: Creating multilingual conversations that demonstrate respectful social relations
3. **Storyboard Creation**: Visual planning of story sequences with illustrations
4. **Audio Narration**: Recording story performances in learners' home languages
5. **Ubuntu Values Reflection**: Connecting story themes to community values

## Portfolio Artifact

Students will produce:
- **Illustrated storyboard** showing the sequence of their greeting story
- **Audio narration** of their story featuring multiple languages and expressive voices

## Resources Needed

- Story decomposition cards (beginning/middle/end organizers)
- Ubuntu values poster highlighting key principles
- Multilingual dialogue templates
- Art supplies for storyboarding (paper, markers, colored pencils)
- Audio recording device (tablet/phone/computer)
- Example stories from South African oral traditions

## Differentiation Support

- **Multiple Entry Points**: 
  - Use pre-made story frames for struggling writers
  - Drama/role-play instead of written scripts
  - Partner storytelling for collaborative support
- **Language Support**: 
  - Story templates in multiple South African languages
  - Visual storyboards as primary mode for ELL learners
  - Audio recording allows oral expression without writing barriers
- **Extension Challenges**: 
  - Add technology elements (LED cues, sound effects)
  - Create branching stories with multiple endings
  - Interview family members about traditional greeting customs
  - Integrate additional languages or regional variations

## Connection to Computational Thinking

This week's focus on **decomposition** teaches learners to:
- Break complex problems into smaller, manageable pieces
- Sequence events in logical order
- Identify dependencies (what must happen before something else)

The emphasis on **abstraction** helps students:
- Focus on important story details while setting aside less relevant information
- Create simplified representations (storyboards) of complex narratives
- Recognize patterns across different greeting scenarios
