# Week 02 Learner Handout — Community Greeting Stories

## Plan Your Story
Fill in your story map:

| --- | --- | --- |
| Beginning | | |
| Middle | | |
| End | | |

## Characters & Setting
Draw or write who is in your story and where it happens.

Characters: ______________________

Place: ___________________________

## Practice Cues
- Who says the greeting first? __________________
- Which button do you press at that moment? ______
- What colours should the audience see? __________

## Retell Challenge
Swap plans with another group. After listening, write the main idea of their story in one sentence:

“This story is about _______________________________________.”

## CT Focus
- □ Decomposition — I broke the story into steps.
- □ Abstraction — I picked the most important details.

## Reflection
Circle one: Our group worked well as a team / We need to practise sharing turns.

How can we welcome others in our community using lights and greetings?
