It was a bright morning in the township. Thabo walked to the community center.

On his way, he saw Gogo (grandmother) sitting on her porch.

"Sawubona, Gogo!" said Thabo. (Hello, Grandmother! - isiZulu)
"Yebo, Thabo! Unjani?" replied Gogo. (Yes, Thabo! How are you? - isiZulu)

Thabo continued walking and saw his friend Lebo playing outside.

"Dumela, Lebo!" called Thabo. (Hello, Lebo! - Sepedi)
"Dumela! O kae?" answered Lebo. (Hello! Where are you going? - Sepedi)

"I'm going to the community center," said Thabo.
"Can I come?" asked Lebo.
"Yes! Let's go together!"

At the corner, they met Mr. Botha, the shopkeeper.

"Goeie môre, Meneer Botha!" they said together. (Good morning, Mr. Botha! - Afrikaans)
"Goeie môre, kinders!" he smiled. (Good morning, children! - Afrikaans)

END:

When they arrived at the community center, Ms. Khumalo was waiting.

"Molweni, children!" she greeted warmly. (Hello, children! - isiXhosa)
"Molweni, Ms. Khumalo!" they responded.

Thabo and Lebo felt happy. By greeting everyone respectfully, they showed Ubuntu - "I am because we are."

They made their community stronger with each greeting.
