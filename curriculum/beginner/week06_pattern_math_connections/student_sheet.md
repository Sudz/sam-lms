# Week 06 Learner Handout — Pattern Maths & Coding

## Pattern Rule
Pattern unit (write colours or letters): ________________________

Repeat how many times? ______

Write the rule in words:

“Repeat __________________________________________ times.”

## Build the Loop
Complete the code snippet with your colours.

```python
pattern_unit = [
    (___, ___, ___),
    (___, ___, ___),
]

for _ in range(___):
    for colour in pattern_unit:
        pixels.fill(colour)
        time.sleep(0.4)
```

## Check Your Algorithm
- □ Lights show the correct colours.
- □ The pattern repeats the right number of times.
- □ There is a pause at the end.

## Compare & Reflect
Manual method: _______________________________

Loop method: _________________________________

Which is easier? Why?

_____________________________________________

## CT Focus
- □ Abstraction — I chose the important colours.
- □ Algorithm Design — I created the loop steps.
