# Week 05 Teacher Guide — Traditional Pattern Weaving

## Overview
- **CT Pillars:** Pattern recognition
- **CAPS Links:** Creative Arts (design), Mathematics (shapes & symmetry), Life Skills (culture)
- **Duration:** 2 × 35-minute sessions
- **Summary:** Learners study Zulu and Ndebele beadwork, recreate colour sequences on NeoPixels, and connect digital patterns to real crafts.

## Learning Objectives
1. Identify repeating units and lines of symmetry in traditional beadwork.
2. Translate a visual pattern into a colour sequence for the Circuit Playground LEDs.
3. Explain how colours can represent cultural meanings.
4. Compare unplugged paper patterns with digital light patterns.

## Materials
- High-resolution images/prints of beadwork
- Pattern tiles or blocks
- Circuit Playground Express with `beadwork_patterns.py`
- Pattern recording sheets
- Optional: beads or buttons for tactile replication

## Session Flow
### Session 1: Explore Patterns
1. **Art Walk (7 min):** Gallery of beadwork images with talk moves (“I notice…”, “I wonder…”).
2. **Mini-Lesson (10 min):** Highlight repeating units (ABAB, ABB). Introduce CT term “pattern recognition”.
3. **Hands-On Build (15 min):** Learners recreate patterns using tiles/beads.
4. **Connect to LEDs (3 min):** Show how each LED can be a “bead”.

### Session 2: Code the Pattern
1. **Review (5 min):** Quick quiz with flashcards.
2. **LED Programming (15 min):** Learners input colour values (template provided) to match chosen pattern.
3. **Pattern Swap (10 min):** Teams trade boards and guess the pattern.
4. **Reflection (5 min):** Journal prompt: “Patterns help us because…”

## Differentiation
- Offer pre-coded template with blanks for younger learners.
- Challenge advanced learners to animate patterns (moving lights).

## Troubleshooting
- If colours wrong, check RGB tuples.
- Remind learners to turn off lights with `(0,0,0)` between patterns when needed.

## Assessment
- Collect pattern recording sheets.
- Observe learners articulating repeating units.
