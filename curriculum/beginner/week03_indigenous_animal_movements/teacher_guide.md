# Week 03 Teacher Guide — Indigenous Animal Movements

## Overview
- **CT Pillars:** Pattern recognition, abstraction
- **CAPS Links:** Natural Sciences & Technology (animals), Life Skills (physical development), Languages (descriptive vocabulary)
- **Duration:** 2 × 35-minute sessions
- **Summary:** Learners investigate how local animals move, match sensor inputs to motions, and explain how sound and light patterns represent behaviour.

## Learning Objectives
1. Describe characteristic movements of springbok, chameleons, and meerkats.
2. Use accelerometer shakes and capacitive touch pads to trigger pre-built motion responses.
3. Match sound frequency and light colour to animal behaviour, explaining the abstraction.
4. Document observations in a simple data table.

## Materials
- Circuit Playground Express with `animal_movements.py`
- Animal fact cards and movement action cards
- Floor tape for “pronking” jump zone (optional)
- Clipboards with observation sheets

## Session Flow
### Session 1: Explore Sensors
1. **Hook (5 min):** Show short video clips of animals pronking, creeping, standing alert.
2. **Sensor Intro (10 min):** Demonstrate shake detection vs touch pads. Learners mimic motions.
3. **Station Rotation (15 min):** Groups rotate through three stations (shake, touch A1, touch A2). Record what they see/hear.
4. **Share Back (5 min):** Groups report one discovery.

### Session 2: Connect & Explain
1. **Warm-up (5 min):** Animal movement charades.
2. **Abstraction Mini-Lesson (5 min):** Discuss how colours/sounds stand for animal traits.
3. **Data Capture (15 min):** Learners complete observation table: input used, output seen/heard, what behaviour it represents.
4. **Reflection Circle (7 min):** Use “Because of… therefore…” sentence stems (“Because the light was green, I think it was the chameleon because…”).

## Differentiation
- Provide picture icons on touch pads for emerging readers.
- Invite advanced learners to suggest alternate colours or sound pitches and justify choices.

## Troubleshooting
- **Sensor too sensitive:** Adjust shake threshold in code or remind gentle taps.
- **No sound:** Check volume slide switch, ensure `play_tone` executed.

## Assessment
- Collect observation sheets and listen for CT language in reflections.
- Quick exit ticket: match animal card to correct sensor input.
