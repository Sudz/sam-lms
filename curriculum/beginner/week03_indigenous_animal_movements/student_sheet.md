# Week 03 Learner Handout — Indigenous Animal Movements

## Observe & Record

| Sensor Input | What did the lights do? | What sound did you hear? | Which animal is this? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Shake the board | | | |
| Touch pad A1 | | | |
| Touch pad A2 | | | |

## Explain the Abstraction
Choose one animal and complete:

“I think the __________________ is shown by the __________ lights because __________________.”

## Movement Practice
Draw or act out each movement:
- Springbok pronk
- Chameleon creeping
- Meerkat alert pose

## Challenge Task
Change the colour for one animal in the code. Why does your new colour fit? Write or draw your idea.

## CT Focus
- □ Pattern Recognition — I spotted how the sounds and lights repeat.
- □ Abstraction — I matched colours/sounds to real movements.

## Reflection
What other South African animal could we add? What sensor should trigger it?
