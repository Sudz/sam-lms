# Week 3: Indigenous Animal Movements

> **Reference:** [SAM LMS Scope & Sequence](../../scope-and-sequence.md)

## Project Overview

This week, learners explore South African wildlife through a computational lens, connecting indigenous knowledge systems with physical computing. Students will study how sensors can detect and respond to movement, while learning about the cultural significance of iconic South African animals.

## Learning Objectives

### Computational Thinking Pillars
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying movement patterns in different animals
- **Abstraction**: Representing complex animal behaviors through simplified LED/sensor responses

### CAPS Curriculum Links
- **Natural Science & Technology**: Animal behavior, habitat, and adaptation
- **Creative Arts**: Movement expression, symbolic representation

## Cultural Connection

This project integrates indigenous ecological knowledge:
- **Springbok**: National animal, represents grace and agility; cultural symbol of South African sport and resilience
- **Chameleon**: Symbolizes adaptation and patience in many African cultures
- **Meerkat**: Community-oriented sentinel behavior mirrors Ubuntu principles of collective care
- Traditional knowledge about animal behaviors and their meanings in Southern African cultures

## Key Activities

1. **Animal Research**: Exploring springbok, chameleon, and meerkat behaviors through stories and videos
2. **Movement Study**: Observing and recreating animal movements through drama and gesture
3. **Sensor Integration**: Using motion sensors to detect movement and trigger responses
4. **Pattern Coding**: Programming LED sequences that represent different animal characteristics:
   - Springbok: Quick, leaping light patterns
   - Chameleon: Slow color-changing sequences
   - Meerkat: Alert sentinel patterns with pauses
5. **Cultural Symbolism Discussion**: Understanding what these animals mean in South African traditions

## Portfolio Artifact

Students will create:
- **Sensor-triggered movement log**: Documentation of how their device responds to different movements
- Video or written record showing the connection between animal behavior and their programmed responses

## Resources Needed

- Circuit Playground Express with motion/tilt sensors
- Animal symbolism guide featuring South African species
- Movement pattern cards illustrating animal behaviors
- Videos or images of springbok, chameleon, and meerkat in their natural habitats
- Traditional stories featuring these animals
- Recording materials for documentation

## Differentiation Support

- **Multiple Entry Points**: 
  - Start with unplugged drama activities (act out animal movements)
  - Use tactile animal models for hands-on exploration
  - Visual pattern cards for planning before coding
- **Scaffolded Support**: 
  - Pre-programmed code templates students can modify
  - Step-by-step visual coding guides
  - Peer partnerships pairing experienced and emerging coders
- **Extension Challenges**: 
  - Add more animal species (lion, elephant, secretary bird)
  - Create complex sensor combinations (motion + light)
  - Research and present on animal conservation efforts
  - Interview community elders about traditional animal stories
  - Design a "virtual zoo" showcase with multiple animal stations

## Connection to Computational Thinking

This week deepens **pattern recognition** by:
- Identifying repeating movement sequences in animal behavior
- Translating physical patterns into digital code patterns
- Recognizing similarities and differences across species

The focus on **abstraction** teaches learners to:
- Simplify complex animal behaviors into key characteristics
- Choose appropriate LED colors/patterns to represent animals symbolically
- Focus on essential features while setting aside less relevant details

## Indigenous Knowledge Integration

This project honors traditional ecological knowledge by:
- Consulting indigenous perspectives on animal behavior and symbolism
- Recognizing that African communities have studied and understood these species for millennia
- Connecting modern technology with traditional observation practices
- Valuing multilingual animal names and cultural stories
