# Week 01 Learner Handout ‚Äî Sawubona Light Responder

## Story Starter
You are welcoming friends from different parts of South Africa. Each greeting lights up a special colour pattern. Press the right button to say Sawubona, Hello, Molo, or Dumela!

## Try It
1. Press **Button A** to send the Sawubona greeting (look for red, black, green).
2. Press **Button B** to send the Hello greeting (look for blue, white, red).
3. Take turns with your partner: one says the greeting aloud, the other presses the button.

## Observe
- What colours did you see?
- How long did the lights stay on each colour?
- Did the lights repeat a pattern?

Write or draw your answers:

| Greeting | Colours I noticed | Something new I learned |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sawubona | | |
| Hello | | |
