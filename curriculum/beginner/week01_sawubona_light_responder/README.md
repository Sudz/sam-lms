# Week 1: Sawubona Light Responder

> **Reference:** [SAM LMS Scope & Sequence](../../scope-and-sequence.md)

## Project Overview

In this first week, learners explore greetings and social relationships through a hands-on physical computing project. Students will create an LED-based greeting system that responds with light patterns representing South African cultural colors, specifically focusing on isiZulu and isiXhosa greetings.

## Learning Objectives

### Computational Thinking Pillars
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying repeating elements in greetings and cultural color schemes
- **Algorithm Design**: Creating step-by-step instructions for LED greeting responses

### CAPS Curriculum Links
- **Languages**: Exploring multilingual greetings (isiZulu, isiXhosa, English)
- **Life Skills**: Understanding social relations and respectful communication

## Cultural Connection

This project centers Ubuntu principles and South African identity:
- Learning traditional greetings: "Sawubona" (isiZulu), "Molo" (isiXhosa)
- Using Zulu flag colors (black, gold, red, green) in LED patterns
- Understanding how technology can celebrate and preserve cultural practices

## Key Activities

1. **Multilingual Greeting Exploration**: Students learn and practice greetings in multiple South African languages
2. **Unplugged Human Robot Activity**: Learners act as "robots" following greeting algorithms before coding
3. **LED Pattern Programming**: Creating light sequences that represent cultural colors and greeting responses
4. **Video Documentation**: Recording their LED greeting demonstrations

## Portfolio Artifact

Students will create an **LED greeting demo video** showing their programmed light responder in action, accompanied by spoken greetings in their chosen language(s).

## Resources Needed

- Circuit Playground Express (or compatible microcontroller)
- Multilingual greeting cards
- Unplugged activity materials
- Video recording device (tablet/phone)
- Cultural color reference guide

## Differentiation Support

- **Multiple Entry Points**: Paper circuit alternatives, drama-based greetings
- **Language Support**: Audio recordings of greetings, visual vocabulary cards
- **Extension**: Add more languages, create complex color patterns, explore greeting customs from different South African cultures
