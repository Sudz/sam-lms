# Week 01 Teacher Guide — Sawubona Light Responder

## Overview
- **CT Pillars:** Pattern recognition, algorithm design
- **CAPS Links:** Life Skills (social relations), Languages (greetings), Creative Arts (colour use)
- **Duration:** 2 × 35-minute sessions
- **Summary:** Learners use the Circuit Playground buttons to trigger greeting light patterns inspired by South African languages and colours, exploring how inputs change outputs.

## Learning Objectives
1. Exchange respectful greetings in isiZulu, isiXhosa, Sesotho, and English.
2. Identify buttons, LEDs, and light patterns on the Circuit Playground and describe their functions.
3. Predict and observe how pressing different buttons changes the lights and sounds, explaining the sequence in simple steps.
4. Reflect on how technology can celebrate cultural identity and inclusivity.

## Materials
- 1 × Circuit Playground Express per pair (or facilitator demo)
- USB power / battery packs
- Printed greeting cards (Sawubona, Molo, Dumela, Hello)
- Colour chips or paper circles (red, black, green, blue, white)
- Optional low-cost alternative: paper plate “controller” with coloured stickers (unplugged simulation)

## Safety & Setup Checklist
- Inspect USB cables for fraying.
- Demonstrate safe handling (hold edges, avoid touching exposed pads when powered).
- Remind learners to keep liquids away from devices.
- Pair learners intentionally for language support (mix home languages when possible).

## Session Flow
### Session 1: Discover & Explore
1. **Warm-up (5 min):** Greeting circle — learners greet neighbour in home language; class echoes.
2. **Introduce Hardware (8 min):** Show buttons A/B, NeoPixels. Model gentle button pressing.
3. **Run Demo Code (5 min):** Press button A (Zulu pattern) and button B (English pattern). Ask what they notice.
4. **Guided Exploration (12 min):** Pairs take turns pressing buttons. Use prompt cards: “What colours do you see? What might they represent?”
5. **Reflection (5 min):** Thumb vote—“Which greeting felt new to you?” Capture responses on board.

### Session 2: Create & Share
1. **Recap (3 min):** Quick quiz: “Which button showed the Zulu colours?”
2. **Decomposition Mini-Lesson (5 min):** Break greeting into steps (say word → press button → lights play → lights rest).
3. **Story Challenge (15 min):** Learners select greeting cards, rehearse saying greeting then pressing matching button. Encourage call-and-response.
4. **Share Circle (10 min):** Groups present greeting-light combo; peers respond with “Sawubona!” etc.
5. **Exit Reflection (2 min):** Learners place sticker on CT pillar poster showing what they practised (patterns vs steps).

## Differentiation Tips
- **Support:** Provide laminated sequence cards with picture cues. Allow unplugged role-play where partner imitates lights with coloured cards.
- **Extend:** Invite confident coders to swap colour values (explain RGB briefly) or add sound cues.
- **Language:** Display multilingual word wall; encourage mixing greetings in story scripts.

## Troubleshooting
- **Buttons unresponsive:** Check power, ensure code uploaded, reset CPX.
- **Colours not matching:** Review that correct button is used; reflash code from `code/sawubona_light.py`.
- **Overstimulation:** Dim lights by reducing brightness slider or turning classroom lights up.

## Assessment Cues
- Observe learners describing patterns (pattern recognition evidence).
- Use mini checklist: greeted partner in assigned language, pressed correct button, explained sequence.
- Collect short audio reflections (tablet/teacher phone) answering: “How did the lights show our greeting?”

## Home/Community Connection
- Send note inviting families to share home-language greetings; suggest learners teach code demo at home using battery pack.
