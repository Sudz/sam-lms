# Week 07 Teacher Guide — Cultural Showcase Build

## Overview
- **CT Pillars:** Decomposition, algorithm design, collaboration focus
- **CAPS Links:** Creative Arts (performance), Languages (oral presentation), Life Skills (community awareness)
- **Duration:** 2 × 35-minute sessions
- **Summary:** Learners plan a mini showcase that blends greetings, animal movements, and patterns into one narrative. Teams assign roles, outline steps, and prepare artifacts.

## Learning Objectives
1. Develop a project plan that sequences greeting, movement, and pattern elements.
2. Assign roles (Speaker, Tech Captain, Designer) and describe responsibilities.
3. Integrate cultural knowledge from previous weeks into a cohesive story.
4. Use a planning board to track tasks and monitor progress.

## Materials
- Project planning boards (3-column: To Do / Doing / Done)
- Role badges or stickers
- Circuit Playground Express devices with previous code variations
- Art supplies for props/posters
- Planning checklist sheets

## Session Flow
### Session 1: Plan & Assign
1. **Launch (5 min):** Show short clip of cultural showcase. Discuss components.
2. **Project Decomposition (10 min):** Model breaking project into tasks (script, code test, prop design).
3. **Team Planning (15 min):** Learners fill planning board and assign roles.
4. **Checkpoint (5 min):** Quick stand-up: “Yesterday we…, Today we…, We need help with…”

### Session 2: Build & Rehearse
1. **Warm-up (5 min):** Role reminder game.
2. **Work Time (20 min):** Teams build props, refine code, practise transitions.
3. **Mini Feedback (7 min):** Pair up teams for quick run-through.
4. **Wrap (3 min):** Update planning boards, set goals for Week 8.

## Differentiation
- Provide visual schedule for groups needing more structure.
- Encourage multilingual narration for language-rich groups.
- Offer advanced teams optional digital storyboard templates.

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure only one learner edits code at a time; use version card to track changes.
- Keep spare batteries/USB for mobility.

## Assessment
- Review planning boards for evidence of decomposition.
- Conduct teacher conference with each team to gauge CT language use.
