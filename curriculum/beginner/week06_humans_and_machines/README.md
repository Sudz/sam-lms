# Week 6: Humans and Machines

> ðŸ“š **Reference**: This module is aligned with the [SAM LMS Scope & Sequence](../../scope-and-sequence.md)

## Overview

In Week 6, learners explore human-computer interaction, understanding how humans and machines communicate and work together. Students create interactive physical computing projects that respond to human input (buttons, sensors) and provide feedback (LEDs, sounds, displays), connecting these concepts to Ubuntu values of interdependence and collaboration.

## Cultural & Contextual Notes

### Ubuntu Philosophy: We Need Each Other

This module emphasizes the interconnectedness of humans and technology through Ubuntu values:

**"Ubuntu ngumuntu ngabantu" - I am because we are**

Just as people need each other, humans and machines work best when they work together:

- **Interdependence**: Neither humans nor machines work alone; we complement each other
- **Communication**: Like people in a community, humans and machines must communicate clearly
- **Mutual Benefit**: Technology should serve human needs; humans guide technology's purpose
- **Accessibility**: Technology should include everyone, just as Ubuntu welcomes all
- **Collective Intelligence**: Combining human wisdom with machine capability

### South African Context: Technology Serving Communities

- **Community Information Systems**: Village phone projects, community radios
- **Healthcare Technology**: Mobile health clinics, remote diagnostics
- **Education Technology**: Radio lessons, mobile learning
- **Agricultural Technology**: Weather alerts, market prices via SMS
- **Ubuntu Innovation**: Solutions that strengthen community bonds

### Human-Centered Design in African Context

- Technology must respect local languages and cultures
- Interfaces should be intuitive for diverse literacy levels
- Solutions should address real community needs
- Traditional knowledge integrated with modern technology

## Project Activities

### Main Activity: Create an Interactive Ubuntu Game

Students will create a simple interactive game that demonstrates human-machine cooperation:

**Game Concept: "Community Helper"**
- Player presses buttons to make choices (help different community members)
- LED indicators show results of choices
- Buzzer provides audio feedback
- Scores track helpful actions (Ubuntu values)

**Learning Sequence:**
1. Explore how humans give input to machines (buttons, sensors)
2. Understand how machines give feedback to humans (lights, sounds)
3. Design a simple interaction flow (algorithm)
4. Program input handling (event detection)
5. Program output responses (LED patterns, sounds)
6. Test and refine for user experience
7. Reflect on human-machine collaboration

### Extension Activities

- Create an **accessibility aid** (e.g., Morse code communicator for those with limited speech)
- Design a **multilingual interface** with buttons for different languages
- Build a **community announcement system** (button press triggers different messages)
- Create a **reaction time game** teaching about human response speeds
- Design an **adaptive interface** that adjusts to different user abilities

## Portfolio Artifacts

Students should collect:

- [ ] Photos/videos of their interactive project in action
- [ ] Drawings showing input-output flow diagrams
- [ ] Code printouts with comments explaining interaction logic
- [ ] User testing notes (observations of others using their project)
- [ ] Reflections on human-machine collaboration and Ubuntu values
- [ ] Design sketches showing consideration for different users
- [ ] Written explanations of how their project helps the community

## Resources Needed

### Hardware
- Raspberry Pi Pico (or compatible microcontroller)
- **Input devices:**
  - Push buttons (minimum 2-3)
  - Optional: Potentiometer (dial/slider)
  - Optional: PIR motion sensor
  - Optional: Light sensor (LDR)
- **Output devices:**
  - LEDs (multiple colors)
  - Passive buzzer or speaker
  - Optional: Small OLED display
- Connecting wires and breadboard
- Resistors (for LEDs and buttons)

### Software
- Thonny IDE with MicroPython
- Code examples (see `/code` folder)
- Flowchart tools for planning interactions

### Learning Resources
- Examples of human-computer interaction in daily life
- Stories of technology serving African communities
- Ubuntu philosophy readings and discussions
- Accessibility guidelines for inclusive design

## Differentiation Support

### For Emerging Learners
- Start with single input â†’ single output (one button â†’ one LED)
- Use physical flowcharts with cards to plan before coding
- Provide pre-written code templates to modify
- Focus on simple cause-effect relationships
- Use visual programming blocks before text code

### For Advancing Learners
- Create complex multi-input systems (button combinations)
- Design state machines (remembering previous interactions)
- Implement timing challenges (reaction time games)
- Create adaptive interfaces that learn from user behavior
- Build accessibility features (alternative input methods)
- Integrate multiple sensors for richer interaction

### Multilingual Support
- Create interfaces with prompts in multiple languages
- Use visual symbols alongside text
- Design for oral communication (audio prompts/responses)
- Include cultural symbols and metaphors familiar to learners

### Accessibility Considerations

- **Visual alternatives**: Use sounds, vibrations, textures
- **Auditory alternatives**: Use lights, displays, tactile feedback
- **Motor alternatives**: Adjust button sensitivity, use voice/motion
- **Cognitive support**: Clear, simple instructions; consistent patterns

## Ubuntu Values in Human-Machine Interaction

### Interdependence (Ukuphilana)
Just as no person is an island, no machine works alone. Humans and machines depend on each other:
- Machines need human guidance and purpose
- Humans benefit from machine capabilities
- Together, we achieve more than separately

### Communication (Ukuhlonipha)
Respectful, clear communication is essential:
- Machines must "listen" carefully to human input
- Humans must give clear, understandable instructions
- Feedback must be timely and appropriate
- Interfaces should respect all users equally

### Community Service (Ukusebenzisana)
Technology should strengthen communities:
- Design solutions for real community needs
- Make technology accessible to all
- Share knowledge and teach others
- Use technology to connect and help people

### Dignity and Respect (Isithunzi)
Every user deserves technology that respects their dignity:
- Accessible to all abilities
- Available in local languages
- Culturally appropriate
- Empowering, not controlling
