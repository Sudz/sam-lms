# Week 5: Mapping Our School

> **Programme Alignment:** This week's content is drawn from the official [SAM LMS Scope & Sequence](../../scope-and-sequence.md)

## Project Summary

In Week 5, learners explore spatial awareness and data representation by creating digital maps of their school environment. Students use sensors to collect location data, practice abstraction by representing real spaces symbolically, and connect computational thinking to familiar physical spaces through Ubuntu principles of community and belonging.

## Learning Objectives

### Computational Thinking
- **Abstraction:** Represent real spaces using symbols, colors, and simplified diagrams
- **Pattern Recognition:** Identify spatial patterns and navigation routes
- **Decomposition:** Break down complex spaces into manageable mapping sections
- **Data Representation:** Convert physical measurements into digital information

### Technical Skills
- Creating simple coordinate systems
- Using sensors for distance measurement
- Basic data collection and recording
- Digital drawing and representation
- Understanding scale and proportion

## CAPS Curriculum Connections

### Mathematics (Foundation Phase)
- Position and orientation (space and shape)
- Measurement (distance, length)
- Simple coordinate concepts
- Comparing sizes and distances

### Life Skills
- Understanding our school environment
- Spatial awareness and navigation
- Sense of place and belonging
- Community spaces and their purposes

### Languages
- Vocabulary for direction and position (left, right, next to, between)
- Multilingual location names (isiZulu, English, Afrikaans)
- Descriptive writing about places

## Cultural Connections

### Ubuntu Values
- **Community:** Our school is a shared space that connects us all
- **Belonging:** Every space in our school has meaning and purpose
- **Shared Responsibility:** We all care for and understand our communal spaces

### Indigenous Knowledge
- Traditional navigation methods and wayfinding
- Importance of place names and their meanings
- Connection between people and spaces
- Cultural significance of community gathering places

## Portfolio Artifacts

Students will create:
1. Hand-drawn preliminary school map
2. Digital map using sensors and coordinates
3. Legend showing symbols for different spaces
4. Reflection on Ubuntu and community spaces
5. Multilingual location labels

## Resources Needed

### Hardware
- Raspberry Pi Pico
- Ultrasonic distance sensor (HC-SR04)
- LEDs for marking locations
- Measuring tape or ruler
- Breadboard and jumper wires

### Digital Resources
- Mapping templates (see `assets/` folder)
- Sample coordinate grids
- Symbol examples for map legends
- Sample code (see `code/` folder)

### Physical Materials
- Paper and pencils for sketching
- Colored markers for legend creation
- Optional: tablet or computer for digital drawing

## Implementation Guide

### Session Structure (3-4 lessons)

**Lesson 1: Exploration and Planning**
- Walk around school identifying key spaces
- Discuss what makes each space important
- Sketch preliminary maps by hand
- Identify spaces to include

**Lesson 2: Measuring and Data Collection**
- Use sensors to measure distances
- Record data systematically
- Practice counting steps and estimating
- Create simple coordinate system

**Lesson 3: Digital Mapping**
- Transfer measurements to digital format
- Create symbols for different spaces
- Add multilingual labels
- Design map legend

**Lesson 4: Sharing and Reflection**
- Present maps to peers
- Discuss Ubuntu connections
- Reflect on sense of place and belonging
- Display maps in classroom

### Differentiation Strategies

**For emerging learners:**
- Focus on simple 2-3 room maps
- Use large grid paper with clear squares
- Provide pre-made symbols to trace
- Partner with advancing learners
- Focus on main spaces (classroom, playground, office)

**For advancing learners:**
- Map multiple floors or outdoor areas
- Include scale and precise measurements
- Create digital interactive maps
- Add directional indicators (compass rose)
- Design QR codes linking to location information
- Compare different types of maps (satellite, street, topographic)

## Assessment

### Formative
- Observation during exploration walks
- Quality of data collection notes
- Participation in group discussions
- Sketch map completeness

### Summative
- Completed digital map with legend
- Accurate representation of school layout
- Multilingual labels included
- Ubuntu reflection statement
- Presentation of map to peers

## Extension Activities

**Community Connections:**
- Map the route from home to school
- Interview staff about favorite school spaces
- Create accessibility maps showing ramps, stairs
- Design treasure hunt using coordinates

**Cultural Extensions:**
- Research traditional place names and their meanings
- Explore how different cultures represent spaces
- Study indigenous wayfinding methods
- Create maps using isiZulu/isiXhosa directional vocabulary

**Technology Extensions:**
- Use GPS coordinates (if devices available)
- Create simple digital maps using free tools
- Add photos to map locations
- Design augmented reality markers for spaces

## Teacher Resources

For detailed implementation guidance, see:
- `teacher-guide.md` (in this folder)
- `student-worksheet.md` (in this folder)
- Sample code in `code/school_mapper.py`
- Visual assets in `assets/` folder

## Safety Considerations

- Supervise students during school exploration
- Establish boundaries for mapping area
- Discuss respectful behavior in all school spaces
- Ensure sensors are used safely
- Be mindful of privacy when photographing spaces

**Ubuntu Principle:** *"I am because we are."* Our school is our shared home. When we understand and care for all its spaces, we strengthen our community and our sense of belonging.
