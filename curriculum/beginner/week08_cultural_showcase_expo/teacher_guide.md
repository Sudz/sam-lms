- **Summary:** Learners finalise their cultural showcase, present to peers/families, and document reflections for digital portfolios.

## Learning Objectives
1. Present a cohesive story combining greetings, animal movements, and patterns with accurate technical execution.
2. Provide and receive audience feedback rooted in Ubuntu values.
3. Reflect on personal growth in CT skills and cultural understanding.
4. Upload or record evidence to the LMS portfolio (photo, audio, rubric).
