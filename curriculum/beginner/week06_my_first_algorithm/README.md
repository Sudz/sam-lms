# Week 6: My First Algorithm

> **Programme Alignment:** This week's content is drawn from the official [SAM LMS Scope & Sequence](../../scope-and-sequence.md)

## Project Summary

In Week 6, learners discover the power of algorithms by creating step-by-step solutions to everyday problems. Students learn to break down tasks into clear sequences, practice logical thinking, and understand how computers follow instructions. This week connects computational thinking to Ubuntu principles of collaboration and problem-solving together.

## Learning Objectives

### Computational Thinking
- **Sequencing:** Arrange steps in logical order to solve problems
- **Decomposition:** Break complex tasks into manageable steps
- **Pattern Recognition:** Identify repeating sequences and processes
- **Logical Thinking:** Use if-then reasoning and decision making
- **Algorithm Design:** Create clear, step-by-step instructions

### Technical Skills
- Writing simple algorithms in plain language
- Translating algorithms into Python code
- Using conditionals (if/else statements)
- Creating loops for repetition
- Testing and debugging algorithms

## CAPS Curriculum Connections

### Mathematics (Foundation Phase)
