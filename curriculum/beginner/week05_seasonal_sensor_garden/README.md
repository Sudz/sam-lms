# Week 5: Seasonal Sensor Garden

> ðŸ“š **Reference**: This module is aligned with the [SAM LMS Scope & Sequence](../../scope-and-sequence.md)

## Overview

In Week 5, learners explore environmental sensors and data collection through the lens of South African seasonal changes and indigenous agricultural knowledge. Students create a "sensor garden" that monitors environmental conditions (temperature, light, moisture) and connects these measurements to traditional planting seasons and cultural practices.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, learners will be able to:

- **Understand sensors** as tools for measuring environmental data
- **Collect and interpret data** from temperature and light sensors
- **Connect computational thinking** to indigenous agricultural knowledge
- **Program conditional statements** (if/then) based on sensor readings
- **Apply pattern recognition** to seasonal changes and plant growth cycles
- **Create data visualizations** of sensor readings

## Computational Thinking Pillars

### Pattern Recognition
- Identifying seasonal patterns in temperature and daylight
- Recognizing relationships between environmental conditions and plant growth
- Observing daily and seasonal cycles

### Data Analysis
- Collecting sensor readings over time
- Comparing data to understand trends
- Making predictions based on patterns

### Conditional Logic
- Using if/then statements: "If temperature > 25Â°C, then water the plants"
- Creating automated responses to sensor inputs
- Decision-making based on data

### Abstraction
- Representing complex environmental systems with simple models
- Using numbers to represent temperature, light, moisture
- Simplifying natural cycles into measurable data points

## CAPS Curriculum Connections

### Natural Sciences (Foundation Phase)
- Life and Living: Plant growth and needs
- Earth and Beyond: Seasonal changes, weather
- Data collection and observation skills

### Mathematics
- Measurement (temperature, time)
- Data handling (graphs, tables)
- Number operations and comparisons

### Life Skills
- Healthy living: Food gardens and nutrition
- Environmental awareness
- Sustainable practices

## Cultural & Contextual Notes

### Indigenous Agricultural Knowledge

This module honors South African traditional farming wisdom:

- **Seasonal Planting**: Traditional calendars based on environmental signs
- **Indigenous Crops**: Amadumbe (taro), maize, sorghum, pumpkins, beans
- **Moon Phases**: Planting according to lunar cycles
- **Weather Signs**: Reading clouds, wind, animal behavior for forecasting
- **Companion Planting**: Traditional crop combinations for mutual benefit
- **Water Conservation**: Indigenous irrigation techniques

### South African Seasons

**Summer (December-February)**
- Hot, rainy in many regions
- Peak growing season
- Time for watering and weeding

**Autumn (March-May)**
- Cooler, drier
- Harvest time for summer crops
- Prepare soil for winter planting

**Winter (June-August)**
- Cold, dry in most areas
- Dormant period for many plants
- Winter crops: Cabbage, spinach, carrots

**Spring (September-November)**
- Warming, new growth
- Main planting season
- Flowers bloom, birds return

### Ubuntu Connection

*"Ubuntu ngumuntu ngabantu"* - We grow together. This module emphasizes:
- **Food sovereignty**: Growing our own food strengthens communities
- **Environmental stewardship**: Caring for the earth for future generations
- **Knowledge sharing**: Learning from elders and community gardeners
- **Collective abundance**: Community gardens feed many families

## Project Activities

### Main Activity: Create a Seasonal Sensor Garden

Students will:
1. Learn about sensors and how they measure environmental data
2. Set up temperature and light sensors
3. Collect data over several days
4. Graph and analyze the data
5. Connect readings to seasonal changes and plant needs
6. Program conditional responses (e.g., LED indicates watering needed)
7. Research indigenous crops suitable for current season

### Extension Activities
- Create a soil moisture sensor for automatic watering alerts
- Build a mini weather station with multiple sensors
- Design a seasonal planting calendar based on local climate data
- Interview community elders about traditional farming practices
- Create a digital garden journal tracking plant growth

## Portfolio Artifacts

Students should collect:
- [ ] Sensor data tables/graphs showing environmental measurements
- [ ] Photos of their sensor garden setup
- [ ] Code printouts with conditional statements
- [ ] Research notes on indigenous crops and seasonal planting
- [ ] Drawings showing sensor placement and garden design
- [ ] Reflections on connections between technology and traditional knowledge
- [ ] Interview notes from community gardeners/elders

## Resources Needed

### Hardware
- Raspberry Pi Pico (or compatible microcontroller)
- Temperature sensor (DHT11 or DHT22)
- Light sensor (LDR - Light Dependent Resistor)
- Optional: Soil moisture sensor
- LEDs for visual indicators
- Connecting wires and breadboard
- Small plant pot with seedling (optional)

### Software
- Thonny IDE with MicroPython
- Code examples (see `/code` folder)
- Data logging and graphing tools

### Cultural Resources
- Information about indigenous South African crops
- Traditional farming calendars
- Local climate data
- Community gardeners/agricultural extension officers

## Differentiation Support

### For Emerging Learners
- Start with single sensor (temperature OR light)
- Use simple if/then statements (one condition)
- Focus on observation and discussion before coding
- Provide pre-written code templates to modify
- Use visual aids (picture graphs) for data

### For Advancing Learners
- Work with multiple sensors simultaneously
- Create complex conditional logic (if/elif/else)
- Build automated watering alerts
- Collect data over longer periods for trend analysis
- Research and present on indigenous agricultural technologies
- Create interactive dashboards for data visualization

### Multilingual Support
- Learn scientific terms in home languages (temperature = umzimba kushisa/ubushushu)
- Use indigenous names for crops and seasons
- Create multilingual labels for sensor garden
- Record weather observations in mother tongue

## Assessment Opportunities

- **Formative**: Observe sensor setup and data collection processes
- **Performance**: Successful programming of conditional responses
- **Data Analysis**: Interpretation of sensor readings and graphs
- **Cultural Integration**: Connection of technology to indigenous knowledge
- **Reflection**: Articulation of learning about seasons, sensors, and sustainability
