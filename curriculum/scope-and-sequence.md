# Scope & Sequence Overview

This map bridges the beginner (Weeks 1-6), intermediate (Weeks 9-16), and capstone pathways into a cohesive programme aligned with South Africa's CAPS curriculum and the four pillars of computational thinking (CT).
| CT Pillar | Learner-Friendly Definition | CAPS Connections | Classroom Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Decomposition** | Breaking a big task into smaller steps | Life Skills: problem solving, Mathematics: sequencing | Planning the showcase: greeting first, then lights, then story |
| **Pattern Recognition** | Spotting what repeats or looks similar | Mathematics: patterns, Creative Arts: design | Identifying colours that repeat in beadwork |
| **Abstraction** | Picking the important details and leaving out the rest | Languages: summarising, NST: models | Choosing green light to stand for a chameleon |
| **Algorithm Design** | Writing the steps so we can follow them the same way each time | Languages: procedural texts, Mathematics: instructions | Coding a loop that repeats red/black three times |

## Programme Goals

- Introduce grades R-3 learners to physical computing through culturally relevant stories, art, and community challenges.
- Develop CT habits (decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, algorithm design) in parallel with CAPS strands (Life Skills, Creative Arts, Mathematics, Languages, Natural Science & Technology).
- Provide scaffolds that grow from guided exploration (Weeks 1-8) to learner-driven problem solving (Weeks 9-16) and community-focused innovation (Capstone).
- Integrate indigenous knowledge systems and multilingual support throughout all learning activities.
