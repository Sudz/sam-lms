# Scope & Sequence Overview

This map bridges the beginner (Weeks 1	6), intermediate (Weeks 9	16), and capstone pathways into a cohesive programme aligned with South Africa's CAPS curriculum and the four pillars of computational thinking (CT).

## Programme Goals

- Introduce grades R	3 learners to physical computing through culturally relevant stories, art, and community challenges.
- Develop CT habits (decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, algorithm design) in parallel with CAPS strands (Life Skills, Creative Arts, Mathematics, Languages, Natural Science & Technology).
- Provide scaffolds that grow from guided exploration (Weeks 1	8) to learner-driven problem solving (Weeks 9	16) and community-focused innovation (Capstone).

## Weekly Flow (Foundation Phase)

| Week | Theme & Activity | CT Pillars | CAPS Links | Key Cultural Connection | Portfolio Artifact |

| 14 | **Digital Drum Circle** | Pattern Recognition, Algorithm Design | Creative Arts (music), Mathematics (rhythm) | Zulu warrior, gumboot, marabi beats | Rhythm notation cards |
| 15 | **Capstone Sprint Planning** | Decomposition, Abstraction | Mathematics (project planning), Life Skills | Ubuntu teamwork agreements | Sprint board photo |
| 16 | **Capstone Demo Day** | All pillars | Languages (presentation), Life Skills (reflection) | Community showcase | Final demo video + rubric |
| 17+ | **Capstone Extensions** | Learner-selected pillars | Cross-curricular | Local challenges (water, safety, culture) | Digital portfolio entry |

## Cross-Cutting Resources

- **CT Mini-Lessons:** 10-minute intros/spots on each pillar, referencing classroom routines (e.g., lining up algorithms).
- **Vocabulary Cards:** English + isiZulu/isiXhosa/Sesotho translations for key words (sensor, pattern, algorithm, Ubuntu).
- **Safety & Care Checklist:** Laminated reference for microcontroller handling.
- **Family Connection Notes:** Take-home slips summarising weekly focus with at-home reflection prompts.

## Integration Pathways

- **Mathematics:** Patterns, counting loops, data tables, and simple graphs from sensor readings.
- **Languages:** Oral storytelling, procedural texts, reflection journals, multilingual greetings.
- **Life Skills:** Community problem solving, health & wellbeing scenarios (e.g., load shedding preparedness).
- **Creative Arts:** Cultural motifs, music rhythms, performance planning with digital props.
- **Natural Sciences & Technology:** Animal behaviours, plant care, energy conservation, weather sensing.

## Progress Checkpoints

- **Week 4:** Peer evaluation of animal movement projects using simplified rubric.
- **Week 8:** Self-reflection audio or drawing on CT skills learned.
- **Week 12:** Evidence of algorithm design in plant helper prototype (flowchart/photo).
- **Week 16:** Capstone presentation assessed with holistic rubric.
- **Portfolio Updates:** Weekly photo or audio artifact uploaded to LMS; badges issued at Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16.

## Differentiation Guidance

- Provide unplugged alternatives (paper circuits, drama) alongside coded versions.
- Offer tactile manipulatives (colour chips, pattern tiles) for learners needing concrete support.
- Extend advanced learners with debug challenges, parameter tweaks, or community interviews.

## Asset Packaging Notes

- **LMS:** Each week exported as a module containing overview page, teacher guide, student handout, media assets, quiz/reflection.
- **Printable Guides:** PDF bundles stored in `curriculum/<track>/<week>/` with matching asset folders.
- **Code Samples:** CircuitPython scripts housed in week-specific `code/` directories and referenced via LMS download links.
