# Computational Thinking & CAPS Primer (Grades R–3)

## The Four Pillars

| CT Pillar | Learner-Friendly Definition | CAPS Connections | Classroom Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Decomposition** | Breaking a big task into smaller steps | Life Skills: problem solving, Mathematics: sequencing | Planning the showcase: greeting first, then lights, then story |
| **Pattern Recognition** | Spotting what repeats or looks similar | Mathematics: patterns, Creative Arts: design | Identifying colours that repeat in beadwork |
| **Abstraction** | Picking the important details and leaving out the rest | Languages: summarising, NST: models | Choosing green light to stand for a chameleon |
| **Algorithm Design** | Writing the steps so we can follow them the same way each time | Languages: procedural texts, Mathematics: instructions | Coding a loop that repeats red/black three times |

## CAPS Integration Overview
- **Life Skills:** Social relationships, creative play, beginning safety awareness.
- **Languages:** Listening & speaking (greetings, storytelling), emergent writing (sequencing sentences).
- **Mathematics:** Foundation Phase patterning, counting, comparing.
- **Natural Sciences & Technology:** Observing animals/plants, understanding energy.
- **Creative Arts:** Visual pattern creation, movement, and music storytelling.

## Classroom Routines Linking CT
- **Morning Meeting Algorithm:** Learners describe arrival steps (hang bag, greet, join circle).
- **Pattern of the Day:** Quick pattern challenge using body percussion or colour tiles.
- **Think-Pair-Share:** Encourage abstraction by summarising partner’s idea in one sentence.

## Vocabulary (English / isiZulu / isiXhosa / Sesotho)
- Pattern — iphethini — iphethini — paterone
- Step — isinyathelo — inyathelo — kgato
- Repeat — phinda — phinda — pheta
- Algorithm — uchungechunge lwamanyathelo — udweliso lwamanyathelo — lenaneo la mehato
- Sensor — inzwa — inzwa — sensor

## Reflection Prompts
- “Where did you break a big task into smaller parts today?”
- “What patterns did you notice in our story?”
- “How did you decide which details to keep?”
- “If you followed your algorithm again, would it work the same way?”
